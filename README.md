# SDET-Challenge Using Cypress

## Introduction

Welcome! This repository contains automated tests for our project using Cypress.
## What You Need

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repo**

   Get the project onto your machine by running:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedlab8/SDET-Challenge.git
   ```

2. **Go to the Project Folder**

   Move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SDET-Challenge
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install Cypress**

   Add Cypress as a development dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```

## Running the Tests

1. **Open Cypress Test Runner**

   To see the tests in action, open the Cypress Test Runner:

   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

   A Cypress window will pop up. Click on a test to run it interactively.

2. **Run Tests in Headless Mode**

   For a quicker run without the GUI, execute:

   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```

   This will run all the tests and show the results in the terminal.
